U know what I mean,
U know what I say,
I'm marching ahead,
Don't get in my way.

I know my weakness,
Like cheap fabric I do fray,
But when I find my right path,
Don't get in my way.

Sleep is like ****ing hell,
Wasting my time when I lay,
"I got switched on", I yell,
Don't get in my way.

With my survival instinct,
I'll make my day,
If u don't wanna cry,
Don't get in my way.

When u enjoy ur life,
Watching fifty shades of grey,
I upgrade my skills, and ensure that u,
don't get in my way.

Everyday I elude the satan,
Who comes for me to slay,
I feel the salvation,
Don't get in my way
